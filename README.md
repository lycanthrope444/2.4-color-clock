# Color Clock

## Synopsis

The first introduction to Javascript at the Iron Yard was this project. A few simple functions power the project, and I 
expanded on the original requirements by adding the radiating sections. I had to provide a clock that would take the time
and convert it to a hexcode color. Mousing over the time shows the hexcode for the color being used. I amplified the changes 
between the colors so that they are more noticeable.
